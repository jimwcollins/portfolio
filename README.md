# Portfolio Website

For my personal profile website, not only was I keen to highlight some of my exciting projects, I also wanted to the site itself to be a showcase of my design and technical skills.

The site was initially wire-framed and designed using UXPin, allowing me to nail the look and feel before I commenced coding. I strove for a clean yet bold look, with judiciously-used animations to bring sections to life. I developed the grid structure of the site in UXPin, allowing for a relatively painless transferral into CSS Grid come the build.

The site began life before I learned React. There was the obvious temptation to redevelop it, but instead I saw it as an excellent opportunity to hone my HTML, CSS and JavaScript without relying on frameworks.

I am now working on adding animations using GSAP.
